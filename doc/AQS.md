## AQS 解析

AQS 即 AbstractQueuedSynchronizer，是一个抽象类，它继承至 AbstractOwnableSynchronizer：

```java
// 首先要确定这是一个同步器，拥有同步器的线程才拥有对应的访问权限。
// 此同步器表示了其本身（同步器）与线程之间的关系 - 独占关系，及线程独占同步器。
public abstract class AbstractOwnableSynchronizer implements java.io.Serializable {

    protected AbstractOwnableSynchronizer() { }

    // 当前独占同步器的线程
    private transient Thread exclusiveOwnerThread;

    // 设置独占此同步器的线程，即设置的线程将拥有访问权限。
    // 当为 null 时，表示没有线程拥有访问权限。
    protected final void setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread thread) {
        exclusiveOwnerThread = thread;
    }

    protected final Thread getExclusiveOwnerThread() {
        return exclusiveOwnerThread;
    }
}
```

### AQS

用于实现依赖于先进先出（FIFO）等待队列的阻塞锁和相关同步器（信号量，事件等）。此类以一个 int 值来表示锁的竞争关系，其子类应该以原子的方式去更新这个值。子类应该定义为非公共的内部类。此类实现了很多方法供其子类使用，如 acquireInterruptibly 等。
#### 用法
通过使用  getState, setState，compareAndSetState 这些方法来重写下面这些方法：

- tryAcquire
- tryRelease
- tryAcquireShared
- tryReleaseShared
- isHeldExclusively

以上的每一个方法都默认抛出 UnsupportedOperationException 异常。这些方法的实现必须保证内部线程安全。独占式同步方式核心如下：

```java
Acquire:
    while (!tryAcquire(arg)) {
        enqueue thread if it is not already queued;
        // 如果线程未入队进行入队操作。
        // 可能阻塞当前线程。
    }
  
Release:
    if (tryRelease(arg))
        unblock the first queued thread;
```

结合重入锁进行分析，首先声明一个公平的可重入锁：

```java
ReetrantLock lock = new ReetrantLock(true);
```

构造方法如下：

```java
public ReentrantLock(boolean fair) {
    // 如果为 true 则创建一个公平的锁，否则创建一个非公平锁
    // FairSync, NonfairSync 都是 ReentrantLock 内部的抽象静态类 Sync 的子类。
    // Sync 继承自 AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
    sync = fair ? new FairSync() : new NonfairSync();
}
```

接下来调用 lock 方法：

```java
lock.lock();
```

ReentrantLock 中 lock 方法如下：

```java
public void lock() {
    sync.lock();
}
```

由于前面创建的是公平锁，所以调用 FairSync 内的 lock 方法：

```java
final void lock() {
    acquire(1);
}
```

这里 acquire 方法来自 AbstractQueuedSynchronizer 的实现：

```java
public final void acquire(int arg) {
    if (!tryAcquire(arg) &&
        acquireQueued(addWaiter(Node.EXCLUSIVE), arg))
        selfInterrupt();
}
```

首先调用 tryAcquire(1)，此方法由子类 FairSync 实现：

```java
protected final boolean tryAcquire(int acquires) {
    // 获取当前线程对象
    final Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
    // 获取 state
    int c = getState();
    if (c == 0) {
        if (!hasQueuedPredecessors() &&
            compareAndSetState(0, acquires)) {
            setExclusiveOwnerThread(current);
            return true;
        }
    }
    else if (current == getExclusiveOwnerThread()) {
        int nextc = c + acquires;
        if (nextc < 0)
            throw new Error("Maximum lock count exceeded");
        setState(nextc);
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```
